The intention of this project was to practice a few functional things 
    - SSH key gen
    - Clone a repo
    - push, pull and add/committ/push
    - command line terminal practice
    - practice python
    - because we love the game and wanted to code it instead of play it #nerds


Our version of puzzle swipe game 2048 
>if a user swipes /UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT (event listeners)
 - a 4x4 grid that is randomly pre-populated
    - combines like numbers, and 
    - provides new digits in some of the empty spaces. 
> the aim is to combine enough 2/4/6/8/16/32/64/128/256/512/1024-> to make 2048 - without running out of space. 
 - Only same numbers combine when they are lined up in adjacent cells, so if 2/2 sit one ontop of another - you can swipe UP/DOWN and they combine to make a 4. 
 - Similarly if 2/2 sit next to each other, swipe LEFT/RIGHT and they combine to make a 4. 
 - again. Only the same numbers combine (2/2 = 4, 4/4 = 8, etc.)
We played a 4x4 grid. the grid randomly generates 2's or BLANKS - as you swipe. Not all cells have to be populated each time you swipe.
